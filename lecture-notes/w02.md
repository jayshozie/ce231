# Interest

- **Definition:** Interest may be defined as the monye paid for the use of
borrowed money. It's expressed as a percentage and if no time is given, then
it's per year. If the question only says that the interest is `12%` then it
means `12% per year`.

## Simple Interest

With simple interest, the interest to be paid for the repayment of a loan is
proportional to the length of time, the interest rate and principal sum that
has been borrowed.

Simple interest is defined as:
```math
I = P * i * n;
\textrm{where,\nI := interest, P := principal, i:= interest rate (\%), n := interest period}
```
